/**
 * Where plot furniture sits, in one place.
 *
 * Every offset around an axis used to be a literal in `plot.tsx` -- a tick at
 * `bottom + 5`, its label at `bottom + 18`, the axis title at `bottom + 42`,
 * and the y title pinned at `translate(18 ...)`. Those numbers were calibrated
 * against roughly 11px type. They are wrong at any other size, and the y title
 * was wrong at *every* size, because `fitPlotToBounds` centres the plot inside
 * the margin box to preserve the coordinate aspect ratio: `plot.left` moves,
 * and a title pinned to the SVG's own left edge does not move with it.
 *
 * So the geometry is derived from the type size instead of chosen for one, and
 * the margins, the axis renderer and the PNG export all read it from here.
 *
 * The stacking rule is DCL's (see ../../Style/Reference/Dennou.md): a row of
 * text costs PAD of its own height as a gap, then its full height, and rows
 * stack without measuring the text. That is what keeps two panels with
 * different labels lining up.
 *
 * Every length here is a multiple of the tick label height, which is DCL's own
 * arrangement one anchor along: DCL measures its ladder against the page
 * (`uzrqnp.f` gives tick 0.007, label 0.021, title 0.028 of the long side),
 * Style re-anchors the same ratios on the tick type size, and this follows
 * Style. The consequence is the one worth keeping: a figure has no absolute
 * size, so what is exported is what was on screen, larger.
 */

/**
 * Tick mark length, in units of the tick label height (Style `rc.TICK_MAJOR`).
 *
 * DCL sizes the whole axis against the page: `RSIZET2` 0.014 against `RSIZEL1`
 * 0.021, so a tick is two thirds of a label. Style re-anchored that ratio on
 * the type size and pulled it back to 0.45, because DCL's own tick runs about
 * a fifth of a tick interval and is far too loud pointing outward.
 *
 * This was a flat 5px, which is the one thing the ladder does not allow: it
 * held at 5px while the type ran from 14px to 22px, so a figure exported large
 * was not the same figure seen small. Nothing in a Dennou plot has a length of
 * its own -- the label height is the unit, and everything else is a multiple.

 * point of naming them is that the pitch now rides the type size instead of
 * being a pixel count that silently crowds the labels as the type grows.
