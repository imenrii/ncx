"""Subset Gorton and National Park. Commit Mono fonts are prebuilt web assets.

    python3 web/scripts/subset-fonts.py

Gorton Perfected is licensed for use, not for redistribution as a font: the
full file must not leave this machine. Serving `GortonPerfected-Regular.otf`
from the viewer would hand every reader a complete, installable copy of it.
So the binary never contains one. This script writes a subset carrying only
the characters below, and `src/server.rs` embeds *that*.

National Park is committed. Gorton sources and subsets are not redistributed.
Commit Mono Web is built by ../Style/Fonts/Commit_Mono/build.py; this script
must not overwrite its customized cuts or the legacy plot fallback.

    pip install fonttools brotli

On the character set: the viewer's own chrome is fixed and scrapeable, but the
text it renders is not -- variable names, units and `long_name` attributes come
out of whatever NetCDF file the reader opens, and could hold anything. So the
set is declared rather than derived: everything the chrome uses, plus the Latin
and scientific ranges that CF metadata realistically reaches for. Anything
outside it falls through to the next family in the CSS stack, per glyph, which
is what a font stack is for. A missing glyph costs a substituted character; it
never costs a tofu box.

This character set applies to Gorton and National Park. Commit Mono Web keeps
all supported upstream characters. CM Math has its own range and metrics.

#: `tnum` and `zero` are what `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums slashed-zero`
#: resolves to. Without them in the subset that declaration is inert, which is
#: what it was until now -- the cut kept `kern` and nothing else. The four
#: stylistic sets are single-glyph drafting forms, taken on `body`: ss02
#: straight-tailed Q, ss04 serifed I, ss06 alternate g, ss12 lowercase
#: ampersand. Gorton's ss01, which the foundry itself names "Not ugly variants",
#: is the opt-in cleanup of precisely the machine forms this interface wants,
#: so it is neither enabled nor subsetted in.

#: Gorton: 400 for text, 600 for the little that needs weight. Hierarchy here is
#: built from size, case, tracking and rules rather than weight (see style.css),
#: so two cuts is the whole range -- shipping seven would be six wasted payloads.

    # backs AVHershey per glyph in the plots, so the original subset carried
    # exactly the ~200 characters an 89-glyph stroke font lacks -- punctuation,
    # accents, dashes -- and deliberately no A-Z, a-z or 0-9, because Hershey
    # already had those.
    #
    # Then it became --label-face, the signage face for every uppercase label in
    # the chrome, and there it is first in the stack rather than a fallback. A
    # face with no letters cannot set the word COLOUR. Every one of those labels
    # was falling past it to system-ui, which on Windows resolves to a CJK UI
    # face. Cutting it to the same set as the others fixes the labels and leaves
    # the fallback job untouched.
